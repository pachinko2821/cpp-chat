# CPP-CHAT

This is a simple chat application written in C++
I am sure this is full of badcode, but hey it WORKS!

# To Do:

* Need to build with cmake, I am building it directly at the moment using `c++`
* Need to figure out port forwarding, for now ngrok does the job
* Need to implement base64 for encoding and decoding the messages, it don't like em special characters
